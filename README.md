# Agile Development Applied to Machine Learning Projects
**Link:** https://www.infoq.com/articles/machine-learning-agile/

This article is interesting in how it explores the development of a new technology like Machine Learning. The article talks about how existing software engineering tools, frameworks and practices are made use of in working with ML projects and how these will inevitably be modified, as well as new tools developed, as ML starts becoming more widely employed in the software engineering world. The article also talks about how some of the tools used in traditional software development do not translate fully to ML component development. For example, reproducibility is several times more challenging in ML or that dependencies exist not only in the code but also in the data for ML systems.

Just as Agile was developed to help product teams understand changes in circumstances and modify their approach to deal with temin order to build tools in such a process that they support repeatibility and can be used easily by others. Similarly, Agile-like techniques can help in Machine Learning by improving communication and the understanding of objectives.


##### Your analysis of this article is spot on and insightful. I agree with the fact that ML is set to dominate the SWE world owing to its convenience and dyanmic nature. - Ayesha
